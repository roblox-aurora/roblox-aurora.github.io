title: Installing Roact DnD
---

# Installing with TypeScript
Installing Roact DnD for TypeScript is relatively straight-forward

Simply run
```bash
npm install --save @rbxts/roact-dnd
```

Then you can import it into your project using

```ts
import RoactDnD from "@rbxts/roact-dnd";
```

# Installing with Lua
_TODO_
